Southpark is a quiet and peaceful place until the latest Terrance and Philip movie comes out.
Once all the kids see it, all hell breaks loose, as the parents try to find a way to stop their kids from saying all the naughty words coming out of their mouths.
The parents blame Terrance and Philip, place them under Citizen's Arrest, and declare war on their home country, Canada.
It is up to the kids to save the world from Satan and keep Terrance and Philip from being executed
