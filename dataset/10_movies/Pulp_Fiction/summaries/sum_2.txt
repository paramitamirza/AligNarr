Jules and Vincent work as hitmen for crime boss Marcellus Wallace.
Wallace is currently dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to throw a fight after taking Wallace's money and is now planning to flee the city, but can't leave his father's watch behind.
Vincent faces some problems of his own when Wallace asks him to show his wife Mia a good time while he's away.
Some of these people redeem themselves and some don't, and all meet an end appropriate to their choices.
