Chuck Noland is a FedEx systems engineer whose personal and professional life are ruled by the clock.
His fast-paced career takes him, often at a moment's notice, to far-flung locales - and away from his girlfriend Kelly.
Chuck's manic existence abruptly ends when, after a plane crash, he becomes isolated on a remote island - cast away into the most desolate environment imaginable.
Stripped of the conveniences of everyday life, he first must meet the basic needs of survival, including water, food and shelter.
Chuck, the consummate problem solver, eventually figures out how to sustain himself physically.
But then what?
Chuck begins his true personal journey.
After four years, fate gives Chuck a chance to fight his way back to civilization, only to find an unexpected emotional challenge greater than all the earlier physical ones.
His ability to persevere and to hope are a product of his life-changing experience.
